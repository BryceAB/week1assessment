// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";

const analysis =
  "Define objectives, project goals, and the functions and operations of the application.";

const design =
  "Detailed screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, pseudocode, and other documentation is layed out. Development begins and secure code is written";

  "The code is tested to make sure it performs all the objectives and integrated with existing programs";

  "Users identify problems with the code and these are put in the queue to get fixed next iteration";
